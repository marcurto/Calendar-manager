# Calendar manager

*Calendar manager* is a small project made in order to practice creating validated forms in React.js with Hooks. Its functionality is to enter the data of a work meeting that will be saved in the Local Storage and that will be displayed as a card as they are created. In turn, they may also be eliminated when considered.

The application has been deployed with Netlify and you can check it [here](https://competent-saha-ca109a.netlify.app/).



## Description
